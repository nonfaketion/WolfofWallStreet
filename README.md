Bank Marketing Data Analysis and Classification Prediction

Project Description: In this project, I will be using a Bank Marketing Data Set that we got from UC Irvine. There are 45211 records (clients) in the dataset and each record will have 17 Attributes. The goal of this project is to test out different models and see which model will yield a better accuracy in determining which client will subscribe a term deposit at the Bank.

Motivation:  This Data Set is from a Portuguese banking institution, and it seems that the data was retrieved through phone calls. This is surprising because there are around 4000 clients, which means that there were over 4000 phone calls in the process of getting all the information. Since the data was retrieved through this method, it made us curious about this data set and is the reason why we are doing our project on this data. 

Background: This Data Set seems very normal in terms of its attributes. There are numeric, binary and text data which make this Data Set very versatile. A lot of companies use this method to retrieve information from their customers and for marketing to benefit their company.
